Features

- Fluid Motion: Physics-based CSS transitions create a high-quality "floating bubble" effect during navigation.
- SVG Masking: Utilizes high-precision SVG curve logic to ensure the "cutout" remains crisp and mathematically perfect across all Retina and high-DPI displays.
- Zero Dependencies: Written in pure JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS3. No heavy frameworks or external libraries required.
- Performance Optimized: Extremely low footprint with hardware-accelerated animations for 60fps performance on mobile devices.
- Responsive Architecture: Defaulted to a "Mobile-First" bottom-docked layout, easily adaptable for various viewport constraints.

Tech Stack

- HTML5: Semantic structure for optimal accessibility (A11y).
- CSS3 (Flexbox & Custom Properties): Leverages modern layout engines and CSS variables for easy theme customization.
- JavaScript (ES6+): Lightweight logic for state management and dynamic coordinate calculation for the indicator.
